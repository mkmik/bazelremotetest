# Sometimes the RBE enviroment is broken or there are networking problems
# this flag allows bazel to continue the build locally.
#
# This is not always 100% safe (see https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7202)
# since this will cause also to upload local results to the remote cache and it's possible
# that the local environment is slightly different from the remote (ubuntu docker image based) env.
# hence we disable this behaviour
